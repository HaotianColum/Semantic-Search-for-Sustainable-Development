 Proxy Statement for McCormicks March 30, 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders
(the 2011 Proxy Statement)
 
Part III  
   


PART I  As used herein, references to McCormick, we, us and our are to McCormick & Company, Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries or, as the
context may require, McCormick & Company, Incorporated only.   


Item 1.
Business  McCormick is a
global leader in flavor with the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of spices, seasonings, specialty foods and flavorings to the entire food industry. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America and
Europe. Additional facilities are based in Mexico, Central America, Australia, China, Singapore, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established
in 1889.  We operate in two business segments, consumer and industrial. The consumer segment sells spices,
herbs, extracts, seasoning blends, sauces, marinades, and specialty foods to the consumer food market under a variety of brands worldwide, including Mc®,
McCormick®, Lawrys®,
Zatarains®, Old Bay®, Thai
Kitchen®, Simply Asia®, Ducros®,
Schwartz®, Vahine®, Silvo®,
Club House®, El Guapo®, Aeroplane®, and
Billy Bee®. The industrial segment sells seasoning blends, natural spices and herbs, wet flavors,
coating systems, and compound flavors to multinational food manufacturers and foodservice customers both directly and indirectly through distributors.  Please refer to pages 16 through 18, of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010 for descriptions of our consumer and industrial businesses, and pages 10 through 14 of our Annual Report to Stockholders
for 2010 for a discussion of growth initiatives for the business. These pages of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010, as well as all other page references to our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010 contained in this Form 10-K, are
incorporated herein by reference.  For financial information about our business segments, please refer to pages 19 through 24,
Managements Discussion and Analysis  Results of Operations of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010, and Note 16, Business Segments and Geographic Areas of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 55 and 56 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010.  For a discussion of our recent acquisition activity, please
refer to page 27 Managements Discussion and Analysis  Acquisitions of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010, and Note 2, Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 42 of the Annual
Report to Stockholders for 2010.  Raw Materials 
The most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products, pepper, capsicums, onion, wheat, soybean oil, and
garlic. Pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the United States. Other raw materials, like cheese and onion, are primarily sourced from within the United States. We are not aware of any government
restrictions or other factors that would have a material adverse effect on the availability of these raw materials. Because the raw materials are agricultural products, they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by
weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, and other factors beyond our control. We respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, and
customer price adjustments.  Customers  McCormicks products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers, wholesalers, and distributors. In the consumer segment, products are resold to consumers through a variety of retail
outlets, including grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount, and drug stores under a variety of brands. In the industrial segment, products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by food
service customers as ingredients for menu items to enhance the flavor of their foods. Customers for the industrial segment include food manufacturers and the food service industry supplied both directly and indirectly through distributors.
 We have a large number of customers for our products. In fiscal year 2008, sales to one of our customers, PepsiCo, Inc.,
accounted for approximately 10% of consolidated net sales. In fiscal year 2009, sales to two of our customers, PepsiCo, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., each accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated net sales. In fiscal year 2010, sales to two
of our customers, PepsiCo, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 10% and 11% of consolidated net sales, respectively. Sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 34% of consolidated net sales for the 2010
fiscal year.  The dollar amount of backlog orders for our business is not material to an understanding of our business, taken
as a whole. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government. 
  1 


Trademarks, Licenses and Patents 
McCormick owns a number of trademark registrations. Although in the aggregate these trademarks may be material to our business, the loss
of any one of those trademarks, with the exception of our McCormick, Lawrys, Zatarains, Club House, Ducros, Schwartz, and Vahine, trademarks, would not
have a material adverse effect on our business. The Mc - McCormick trademark is extensively used by us in connection with the sale of our food products in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. markets. The terms of the trademark registrations
are as prescribed by law and the registrations will be renewed for as long as we deem them to be useful.  We have entered into
a number of license agreements authorizing the use of our trademarks by affiliated and non-affiliated entities. The loss of these license agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The term of the license agreements is
generally three to five years or until such time as either party terminates the agreement. Those agreements with specific terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties.  We also own various patents, none of which individually are viewed as material to our business.  Seasonality  Due to seasonal factors inherent in McCormicks
business, our sales, income, and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year, increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. This seasonality
reflects customer and consumer buying patterns, primarily in the consumer segment.  Working Capital 
In order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter, McCormick usually builds its inventories during the
third quarter of the fiscal year. We generally finance working capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of our liquidity
and capital resources, see Note 6 Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 43 and 44 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010, and the Liquidity and Financial Condition section of
Managements Discussion and Analysis on pages 24 through 27 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010. 
Competition  McCormick competes in a geographic market that is international and highly competitive. Our strategies for competing in each of our segments include a focus on price and value, product quality and
innovation, and superior service. Additionally, in the consumer segment, we focus on brand recognition and loyalty, effective advertising, promotional programs, and the identification and satisfaction of consumer preferences. For further discussion,
see pages 16 through 18 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010.  Research and Development 
Many of McCormicks products are prepared from confidential formulas developed by our research laboratories and product development
teams, as well as from, in some cases, customer proprietary formulas. Expenditures for research and development were $52.7 million in 2010, $48.9 million in 2009, and $51.0 million in 2008. The amount spent on customer-sponsored research activities
is not material to us.  Environmental Regulations 
The cost of compliance with federal, state, and local provisions related to protection of the environment has had no material effect on
McCormicks business. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal year 2010 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in fiscal year 2011. 
Employees  McCormick had approximately 7,500 full time employees worldwide as of December 31, 2010. We believe our relationship with employees to be good. We have no collective bargaining contracts in the
United States. At our foreign subsidiaries, approximately 1,300 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements.  Financial Information about Geographic Locations  For information on
the net sales and long-lived assets of McCormick by geographic area, see Note 16, Business Segments and Geographic Areas of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 55 and 56 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010.

Foreign Operations 
McCormick is subject in varying degrees to certain risks typically associated with a global business, such as local economic and market
conditions, restrictions on investments, royalties and dividends, and exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 39% of sales in fiscal year 2010 were from non-U.S. operations. For information on how McCormick manages these risks, see the
Market Risk Sensitivity section of Managements Discussion and Analysis on pages 27 through 29 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010.  Forward-Looking Information  For a discussion of forward-looking
information, see the Forward-Looking Information section of Managements Discussion and Analysis on page 32 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2010. 
Available Information  Our principal corporate internet website address is: www.mccormickcorporation.com. We make available free of charge through our website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,
current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are
electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The SEC maintains an Internet web site at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other
information regarding McCormick. Our website also includes our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Business Ethics Policy and charters of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of
Directors.   


Item 1A.
Risk Factors  The
following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Before you buy our Common Stock or Common Stock Non-Voting, you should know that making such an
investment involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks that have been highlighted here are not the only ones that we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could
be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.  Damage to Our Reputation or Brand Name, Loss of Brand Relevance, Increase in Private Label Use by Customers or Consumers, or Product Quality or Safety Concerns Could Negatively Impact Us.
 Our reputation for manufacturing high-quality products is widely recognized. In order to safeguard that reputation, we
have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure conformity to specification and compliance with law. We also continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and
consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brand through effective marketing and other measures. A serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures, deterioration of our quality image, impairment of our customer or
consumer relationships, or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brand, which may lead to customers or consumers purchasing other brands or private label brands that may or may not be manufactured by us, could have a material negative
impact on our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, our customers evaluate their mix of branded and private label product offerings. If a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label, it could
have a significant impact on our consumer business.  The food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage
and contamination, product tampering, product recall, and consumer product liability claims. For instance, we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated or damaged. We also may become involved in
lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury or illness. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could cause consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence
in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients, and otherwise have a negative effect on our business and financial results. Negative publicity about these concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our
products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our reputation or brands. 
The Consolidation of Customers May Put Pressures on Our Operating Margins and Profitability. 
Our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is
expected to continue throughout the U.S., the European Union, and other major markets. Such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying

  3 



power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories, resisting price increases, demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products, and
shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label products. These factors and others could have an adverse impact on our future sales growth and profitability. 
Issues Regarding Procurement of Raw Materials May Negatively Impact Us. 
Our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting
conditions, market conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. The most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products, pepper, capsicums, onion, wheat, soybean oil, and garlic. While future price
movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, and customer price adjustments. We have not used
derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. Any actions taken in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that
future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.  In addition, we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the availability risk of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield, political unrest in the producing countries, changes
in governmental agricultural programs, and other factors beyond our control. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, or operating results.
 Further, political, socio-economic, and cultural conditions, as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities, in
developing countries create risks for food safety. Although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products, we cannot provide assurance that such events will
not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.  Our Profitability May Suffer as a
Result of Competition in Our Markets.  The food industry is intensely competitive. Competition in our product
categories is based on price, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. From time to time, we may need to
reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Such pressures also may impair our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases. 
Laws and Regulations Could Adversely Affect Our Business 
Food products are extensively regulated in many of the countries in which we sell our products. The Company is subject to numerous food
safety and other laws and regulations relating to the manufacture, storage, marketing, advertising, and distribution of food products, including laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements, the environment, relations with
distributors and retailers, employment, health and safety, and trade practices. Enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements, and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result in increased
compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect the Companys business and/or financial results.  Our Operations may be Impaired as a Result of Disasters, Business Interruptions or Similar Events.  A natural disaster such as an earthquake, fire, flood, or severe storm, or a catastrophic event such as a terrorist attack, an epidemic affecting our operating activities, major facilities, or
employees and customers health, or a computer system failure, could cause an interruption or delay in our business and loss of inventory and/or data or render us unable to accept and fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all.
In addition, some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather; a major storm, heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner. 
We cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or
other unanticipated issue, and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that an earthquake, natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event
were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, and operating
results could be seriously harmed.  We May Not Be Able to Successfully Consummate Proposed Acquisitions or Divestitures
or Integrate Acquired Businesses.  From time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of
our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These potential acquisitions and divestitures may present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including 
  4 



diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses, assumption of unknown
liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers. In addition, we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired
businesses which may reduce our profitability. If we are unable to consummate such transactions, or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our financial results could be adversely
affected.  Our Foreign Operations are Subject to Additional Risks. 
We operate our business and market our products internationally. In fiscal year 2010, 39% of our sales were generated in foreign
countries. Our foreign operations are subject to additional risks, including fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, discriminatory fiscal policies, compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, enforcement of remedies in
foreign jurisdictions, and other economic or political uncertainties. Additionally, international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions. All of these risks could result in
increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could adversely affect our profitability.  Fluctuations in
Foreign Currency Markets May Negatively Impact Us.  We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following
main areas: cash flows related to raw material purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars; the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of
these investments. Primary exposures include the British pound sterling versus the Euro, and the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi, and Thai baht. We routinely
enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks. However, these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency
exchange changes. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial position, or operating results. 
Increases in Interest Rates May Negatively Impact Us. 
We had total outstanding short-term borrowings of approximately $0.2 million at an average interest rate of approximately 8.8% on
November 30, 2010. Our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and
variable rate debt. We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor
are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments. Our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. However, our use of these instruments
may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate increases will not have a material negative impact on our business, financial position, or operating
results.  The Deterioration of Credit and Capital Markets May Adversely Affect our Access to Sources of Funding.
 We rely on our revolving credit facilities, or borrowings backed by these facilities, to fund a portion of our
seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. If any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could adversely affect funding of
seasonal working capital requirements. The Company engages in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities. During these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to
perform on their commitments. In addition, management periodically reviews our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions, pricing we receive on services, and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these
communications and our monitoring activities, management believes the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote.  In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other
sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time, if at all. Our inability to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us could have an adverse
impact on our operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  We Face Risks Associated With Certain Pension Assets and
Obligations.  We hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a
rabbi trust for our U.S. non-qualified pension plan. Deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise, could cause (or increase) an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans, thereby
increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other 
  5 



corporate uses, and may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.  The Global Financial Downturn Exposes Us to Credit Risks from Customers and Counterparties.  Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged. In addition, competition has increased with the growth in
alternative channels through our customer base. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Current credit markets are volatile, and some of our customers and counterparties are highly
leveraged. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect
receivables. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.
